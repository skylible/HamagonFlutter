# hamagon

Hamagon is a pest image identifier app. Hamagon uses Flutter as it's framework. It also uses Firebase VisionEdge to train and create a computer vision model. Firebase Vision Edge doesn't currently have any example of how to use their library without signing up to Blaze package. This app doesn't need to use Blaze package. You can use the free Spark package. Feel free to use this app as example/base for your flutter app that uses 
Firebase VisionEdge.
